<p><strong>Signing up to Amazon Web Services</strong></p><p>In this section, I will guide you through the process of deploying an application to AWS using the Elastic Beanstalk service.</p><p>This requires you to have an Amazon Web Services account. During registration, you will have to provide payment details.</p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up to&nbsp; Amazon Web Services</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>AWS&nbsp;Free Tier</strong></p><p>Amazon Web Services offer a Free Tier for one year. During this one year, you are eligible for free usage of services (not all of them).</p><p>It's important that there are limitations to the free tier. Please make sure to read the Pricing section of each service when using AWS&nbsp;to be up-to-date with the latest Free Tier policies.</p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Read more on the AWS&nbsp;Free Tier</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Free Tier and This Course</strong></p><p>Throughout the course I only used services and configurations that fall under the free tier. However, I&nbsp;do not take responsibility for any costs that you might encounter due to incorrect AWS&nbsp;usage or deviation from the Free Tier.</p><p>It is your own responsibility to continuously check the AWS&nbsp;Free Tier quotas.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>General Advice</strong></p><ul><li><p> If you use AWS for testing and education, make sure to turn off the services when you are done. This will help you prevent unwanted payments to AWS.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>If you run services that are consumed by users, periodically check the AWS&nbsp;Billing Dashboard to keep an eye on your usage and costs.<br></p></li><li><p>You can use the Billing Dashboard to set up a budget as well as e-mail notifications for when the budget is forecasted to be exceeded.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Good luck!</p>
