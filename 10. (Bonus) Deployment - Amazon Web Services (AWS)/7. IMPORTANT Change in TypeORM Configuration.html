<p><strong>IMPORTANT: TypeORM&nbsp;Configuration Change (already mentioned previously)</strong></p><p>In the previous lecture, we've set up the TypeORM&nbsp;configuration to use environment variables as well as file-based configuration.<br></p><p>There is one more important thing that I&nbsp;forgot to add in that lecture. When we start the application in production, the TypeScript code is the transpiled into JavaScript. Therefore, our entity files (<strong>*.entity.ts</strong>) will not be picked up by TypeORM.</p><p><br></p><p>Fixing this is easy. Simply change the "entities" configuration to this:</p><p><code>entities: [__dirname + '/../**/*.entity.<strong>{js,ts}</strong>']</code> </p><p><br></p><p>Notice the <strong>{js,ts}</strong> part. This means that both .js and .ts extensions will be picked up.</p><p>___</p><p><br></p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience!</p><p>I will do my best to re-record this lecture as soon as possible.</p>
