<p><strong>Testing Final Words</strong></p><p>Dear student,</p><p>Thanks for watching the Testing section!</p><p>I&nbsp;hope you learned a lot. I did not cover the whole codebase with tests, but I did my best to cover the most tricky/important bits of a NestJS application, as well as different types of files (service, repository, entity, plain class etc).</p><p>Please feel free to go ahead, fork the repository (you can find it in the next lecture) and add more tests of your own!</p><p><br></p><p>Don't forget to use the<a href="https://jestjs.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Jest Official Documentation</a> in case you are struggling!</p><p><br></p><p>Good luck,</p><p>Ariel</p>
