<p><strong>Note regarding HTTPS</strong></p><p>If you plan to go to production with any NestJS&nbsp;application, or any application at all, make sure to introduce HTTPS.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><p>When you communicate via <strong>HTTP</strong>, the data transferred over the network is available for attackers to sniff. If there is an attacker sniffing your network, he/she will be able to, for example, read your plain-text passwords or get the access token from your request.</p><p>When communicating over <strong>HTTPS</strong>, the data transferred is encrypted and only the server is able to decrypt it using a private key.</p><p><strong>How?</strong></p><p>Setting up HTTPS with a certificate is very easy these days and can especially be reliably and easily done within Amazon Web Services, or any other major trusted authority.</p><p>Specifically for AWS, here is some reading material:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/configuring-https.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Configuring HTTPS for Your Elastic Beanstalk Environment</strong></a></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15719764/https-for-amazon-s3-static-website" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>StackOverflow - HTTPS&nbsp;for Amazon S3 Static Website</strong></a></p></li></ul>
